# A VIPER Architecture Sample (SwiftUI)

This is a simple iOS app built with **SwiftUI** to demonstrate the **VIPER architecture** in practice.

## ðŸ“± Features

- Loads a list of movies from a local JSON file.
- Displays movie titles in a scrollable list.
- Navigates to a detailed view when a movie is selected.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

This app is built using the **VIPER** design pattern, which separates concerns across:

- **View** â€“ SwiftUI views that handle UI.
- **Interactor** â€“ Handles business logic and data fetching.
- **Presenter** â€“ Processes data from the Interactor and prepares it for display.
- **Entity** â€“ Basic data models (e.g., `Movie`).
- **Router** â€“ Handles navigation and routing logic.
